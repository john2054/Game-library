France, Italy, South Africa. And as a man Kenya, well at least that was where i became a man. And then Kenya again and again.

Before i finally won the visas to bring my wife and daughter back to live with me. Here in the UK.

Also i have written four books, which i am in the process of doing a complete edit, for each one of them.
I am up to about chapter three on my third book, Fighting Madness. And I am both shocked, and encouraged by reworking this material.
I want to leave publications i am proud of.

I also have two red belts, in Judo and Wado ryu Karate, and two yellow belts, of different schools of Aikido, which may not mean much to
others but they mean a lot to me.

I also have a degree, which took me the better part of my adult life, and when i was still a boy too. I got it. Now we can put it down.

Back to the holidays, maybe i can include scans of my passport stamps, as proof of travel? I dunno, what do you think?

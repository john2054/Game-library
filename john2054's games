Let me start with the beast that is Final Fantasy 7. I was completely broken, and rebuilt by mastering this game.
Which included unlocking the twelve Zodiac attack for Cloud, and also defeating all three or four elder dragon legends
at the end of the game.
After that came final fantasy 9, which i beat included getting 100% in the march and 100% in the skipping game.
I also managed to beat final fantasy x-2. Which was fun.
Of the Call of duty games, I have completed modern warfare 4, advanced warfare, World at war, and i am working my way through the cod games
I have also completed Grand theft auto 5
the Elder Legends Skyrim
And I am in the midst of killing (completing) Fallout 4, if it doesn't kill me first?!

I also want to do a section on girl friends i have had, first and third base,,, I need to be careful here though? Food for thought...
